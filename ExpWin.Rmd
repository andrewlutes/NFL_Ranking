Exponential Win Percentage
----------------------------


# The basics

The adjacency matrix gives us an idea of who has beaten who, but we generally want to examine teams who haven't played each other.
In this context we will want to take powers of the adjacency matrix to examine performance among common opponents.

$$
E=\SigmaA+ A^2/2! + A^3/3! +A^4/4!... =e^A-I
$$

Then we could do shit like THIS:

```{r}
expWin <- function(adj, schedDep=1){
  library(expm)
  #Exponential Adjacency matrix 
  expAdj=expm(schedDep*adj)-diag(dim(adj)[1])

  #Exponential based win pct
  expAdj=expAdj/(expAdj+t(expAdj)) #Scale so that each cell represents a unit probability
  
  #Find the exponential win and loss record for each team
  Exp=data.frame(name=row.names(adj), win=colSums(expAdj, na.rm=TRUE), loss=rowSums(expAdj, na.rm=TRUE)) 
  #Scale to find exponential win percentage
  Exp=as.numeric(Exp$win/(Exp$win+Exp$loss))
  names(Exp)<-row.names(adj)
  
  return(list(expAdj, Exp))
}
```

Ain't that some shit?
